# RECIPES LIST


### About
This is the just a simple recipe page I am making for my odin project.
I have used all the things they taught me during the precious lessons

From using html-boilerplate, images,links,etc in the previous chapters

Although I didnt use the images thing they mentioned about creating images directory 
why? because i used the direct links to those images.

Its my first time so i did what i thought was right i hope it helps my fellow odinite :)
